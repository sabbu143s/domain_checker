# domain_checker
ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Domain Checker is a cybersecurity tool that analyzes and verifies a domain's authenticity to detect potential threats. It helps determine whether a domain is safe, suspicious, or potentially used for phishing by checking:

âœ… Domain existence & validity (DNS & WHOIS records)
âœ… Mail Exchange (MX) records (Is the domain capable of sending emails?)
âœ… Domain registration age (Newly registered domains are riskier)
âœ… Disposable or temporary email domains (Often used for fraud)
âœ… Blacklist check (Is the domain flagged as malicious?)
